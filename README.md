# PenetrationTestingProject

In this project we implemented black box pentesting using some tools such as mobSF, jadx, and ADB with an apk that was called InsecureShop.apk
Blackbox pen testing is security testing where the tester simulates an external attacker with no prior knowledge of the system being tested in order to identify potential vulnerabilities.
